# Programming Exercise 4-8: Sum of Numbers
#
# Task: Write a program that calculates the sum of positive numbers entered by the user.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Use a while loop to continuously ask for numbers
# 2. Ask the user to enter a positive number
# 3. Continue accepting numbers until a negative number is entered
# 4. Add only positive numbers to the running total
# 5. Display the total sum when the user quits
#
# Logic:
# - Use while number > 0 to continue the loop
# - Ask for input inside the loop
# - Check if number > 0 before adding to total
# - Exit loop when negative number is entered
# - Display final total formatted to 2 decimal places
#
# Example:
# Enter a positive number (negative to quit): 5
# Enter a positive number (negative to quit): 10
# Enter a positive number (negative to quit): 3
# Enter a positive number (negative to quit): -1
# Total = 18.00
