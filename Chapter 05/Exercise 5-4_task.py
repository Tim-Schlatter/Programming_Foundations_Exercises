# Programming Exercise 5-4: Vehicle Expense Calculator
#
# Task: Write a program that calculates total vehicle expenses using functions.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Create a main function that collects all monthly vehicle expenses
# 2. Create a showExpenses function that calculates and displays totals
# 3. Ask the user to enter monthly amounts for:
#    - Loan payment
#    - Insurance
#    - Gas
#    - Oil
#    - Tires
#    - Maintenance
# 4. Calculate total monthly and annual expenses
# 5. Display the expense breakdown
#
# Functions:
# - main(): collects input and calls showExpenses()
# - showExpenses(loan, insure, gas, oil, tires, maintenance): calculates and displays totals
#
# Logic:
# - Get all monthly expense amounts from user
# - Pass all values to showExpenses function
# - Calculate total monthly = sum of all expenses
# - Calculate total annual = monthly total * 12
# - Display formatted currency output
#
# Example:
# Enter the monthly loan amount: 300
# Enter the monthly insurance amount: 100
# Enter the monthly gas amount: 150
# Enter the monthly oil amount: 20
# Enter the monthly tires amount: 50
# Enter the monthly maintenance amount: 80
# Total monthly expense: $700.00
# Total annual expense: $8,400.00
