# Programming Exercise 5-9: Feet to Inches Converter
#
# Task: Write a program that converts feet to inches using functions.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Create a main function that handles user input and calls conversion function
# 2. Create a feet_to_inches function that performs the conversion
# 3. Ask the user to enter the number of feet
# 4. Convert feet to inches and display the result
#
# Functions:
# - main(): handles input and calls feet_to_inches()
# - feet_to_inches(feet): converts feet to inches and returns result
#
# Logic:
# - Get number of feet from user
# - Call feet_to_inches function with feet value
# - Calculate inches = feet * 12
# - Return inches value
# - Display conversion result in main function
#
# Conversion factor: 1 foot = 12 inches
#
# Example:
# Enter the number of feet: 5
# 5.0 feet = 60.0 inches
