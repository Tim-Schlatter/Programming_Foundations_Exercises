# Programming Exercise 5-ter1: Maximum of Three Numbers
#
# Task: Write a program that finds the maximum of three numbers using functions.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Create a find_max function that compares three numbers
# 2. Ask the user to enter three integers
# 3. Use the function to find and display the maximum
# 4. Use type hints to specify return type
#
# Functions:
# - find_max(a, b, c) -> int: returns the maximum of three numbers
#
# Logic:
# - Get three integers from user
# - Use if-elif-else statements to compare numbers
# - Check if 'a' is greater than or equal to both 'b' and 'c'
# - Check if 'b' is greater than or equal to both 'a' and 'c'
# - Otherwise, 'c' is the maximum
# - Return the maximum value
#
# Type Hints:
# - Use -> int to specify function returns an integer
#
# Example:
# Please enter an integer: 15
# Please enter an integer: 8
# Please enter an integer: 22
# The maximum of numbers entered is 22
