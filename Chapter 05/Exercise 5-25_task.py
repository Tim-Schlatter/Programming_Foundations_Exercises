# Programming Exercise 5-25: Turtle Graphics - City Skyline
#
# Task: Write a turtle graphics program that draws a city skyline with stars and buildings.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Import turtle and random modules
# 2. Create multiple functions for different parts of the scene
# 3. Draw random stars in the sky
# 4. Draw buildings with a skyline profile
# 5. Draw windows on the buildings
#
# Functions:
# - main(): calls all drawing functions
# - screen_setup(): sets up the turtle screen
# - draw_stars(): draws random white stars
# - draw_buildings(): draws gray buildings with skyline
# - draw_windows(): draws white windows on buildings
# - square(x, y, width, color): draws filled squares for windows
#
# Constants:
# - Screen dimensions and boundaries
# - Star count and coordinates
# - Building profile coordinates
# - Window positions and sizes
#
# Logic:
# - Set up black background screen
# - Generate random star positions
# - Draw buildings using turtle.goto() and turtle.forward()
# - Draw windows using square function
# - Use appropriate colors (white stars, gray buildings, white windows)
#
# Scene Elements:
# - Black background representing night sky
# - 20 random white stars
# - Gray buildings with varying heights
# - White square windows at specific positions
#
# Result: Complete city skyline scene with stars and illuminated buildings
