# Programming Exercise 5-10: Math Quiz Generator
#
# Task: Write a program that generates random addition questions using functions.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Import the random module
# 2. Create a main function that generates multiple questions
# 3. Create a generate_question function that creates random addition problems
# 4. Generate 5 questions with numbers between 1 and 10

#
# Functions:
# - main(): generates multiple questions using a loop
# - generate_question(max_number): creates random addition question
#
# Logic:
# - Use for loop to generate 5 questions
# - Use random.randint(1, max_number) to generate random numbers
# - Format question as "num1 + num2 = _____"
# - Display question number and generated question
#
# Example output:
# Question 1
# 7 + 3 = _____
