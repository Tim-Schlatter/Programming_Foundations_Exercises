# Programming Exercise 3-ter1: Grade Calculator with Multiple Methods
#
# Task: Write a program that calculates letter grades using both if-elif-else and match-case statements.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Ask the user to enter a test score
# 2. Calculate the letter grade using if-elif-else structure:
#    - 90-100: A
#    - 80-89: B
#    - 70-79: C
#    - 60-69: D
#    - Below 60: F
# 3. Calculate the letter grade using match-case structure (Python 3.10+)
# 4. Display both results
#
# Constants:
# - A_score = 90
# - B_score = 80
# - C_score = 70
# - D_score = 60
#
# Methods to demonstrate:
# - Traditional if-elif-else with >= comparisons
# - Modern match-case with pattern matching
#
# Example:
# Enter your test score: 85
# Your grade is B.
# Your grade is B.
#
# Note: Both methods should produce the same result
