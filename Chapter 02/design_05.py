# Design Exercise 5: Turtle Graphics - Compass Rose
#
# Task: Use turtle graphics to draw a compass rose with labeled directions.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Import the turtle module
# 2. Define named constants:
#    - CENTER_X = 0, CENTER_Y = 0
#    - X_AXIS_LENGTH = 200, Y_AXIS_LENGTH = 200
#    - RADIUS = 25
#    - SOUTH = 270, EAST = 0
# 3. Hide the turtle and set animation speed to 0
# 4. Draw the X axis (horizontal line)
# 5. Draw the Y axis (vertical line pointing south)
# 6. Draw a center circle at the intersection
# 7. Add text labels:
#    - "North" at the top of Y axis
#    - "South" at the bottom of Y axis
#    - "West" at the left of X axis
#    - "East" at the right of X axis
#
# Note: Use turtle.write() for text labels and position them appropriately
#
# Expected result: A compass rose with labeled cardinal directions and a center circle
