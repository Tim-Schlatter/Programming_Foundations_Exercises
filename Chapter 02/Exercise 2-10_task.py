# Programming Exercise 2-10: Cookie Recipe Calculator
#
# Task: Write a program that calculates the ingredients needed for a cookie recipe.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Ask the user to enter the number of cookies they want to make
# 2. Calculate the cups of sugar needed
# 3. Calculate the cups of butter needed
# 4. Calculate the cups of flour needed
# 5. Display all ingredient amounts formatted to 2 decimal places
#
# Constants (original recipe for 48 cookies):
# - COOKIES_RECIPE = 48.0
# - SUGAR_RECIPE = 1.5 cups
# - BUTTER_RECIPE = 1.0 cups
# - FLOUR_RECIPE = 2.75 cups
#
# Formulas:
# - sugar = (cookies * SUGAR_RECIPE) / COOKIES_RECIPE
# - butter = (cookies * BUTTER_RECIPE) / COOKIES_RECIPE
# - flour = (cookies * FLOUR_RECIPE) / COOKIES_RECIPE
#
# Example:
