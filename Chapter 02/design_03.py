# Design Exercise 3: Turtle Graphics - Connected Squares
#
# Task: Use turtle graphics to draw two squares connected by lines.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Import the turtle module
# 2. Define named constants for all square coordinates:
#    - Top square coordinates (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
#    - Bottom square coordinates (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
# 3. Hide the turtle cursor and raise the pen
# 4. Draw the top square by connecting its corners
# 5. Draw the bottom square by connecting its corners
# 6. Connect the corners between the two squares:
#    - Bottom square bottom-right to top square top-left
#    - Bottom square top-right to top square top-right
#    - Bottom square bottom-left to top square bottom-left
#
# Note: Use penup() and pendown() to move between drawing areas
#
# Expected result: Two squares with connecting lines forming a 3D-like effect
