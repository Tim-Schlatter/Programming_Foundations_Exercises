# Programming Exercise 2-12: Stock Transaction Program
#
# Task: Write a program that calculates the profit or loss from a stock transaction.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Calculate the amount paid for the stock (shares * purchase price)
# 2. Calculate the commission paid on the purchase (3% of amount paid)
# 3. Calculate the total amount paid (stock cost + purchase commission)
# 4. Calculate the amount the stock sold for (shares * selling price)
# 5. Calculate the commission paid on the sale (3% of selling amount)
# 6. Calculate the total amount received (selling amount - selling commission)
# 7. Calculate the profit or loss (total received - total paid)
# 8. Display all amounts formatted as currency
#
# Constants:
# - COMMISSION_RATE = 0.03 (3%)
# - NUM_SHARES = 2000
# - PURCHASE_PRICE = 40.0
# - SELLING_PRICE = 42.75
#
# Example output:
# Amount paid for the stock: $80,000.00
# Commission paid on the purchase: $2,400.00
# Amount the stock sold for: $85,500.00
# Commission paid on the sale: $2,565.00
# Profit (or loss if negative): $535.00
